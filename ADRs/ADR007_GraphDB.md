# ADR 007: GraphDB

Graph is opted and Neo4J will be used as the Graph database.
The architecture behind is designed for optimal management, storage, traversal of nodes and relationships as NPC Service Offerings have to be reached to the maximum onboarded candidates. Graph DB gives the relationships and the primary problem statement how to bridge both the NPC and the candidates 

## Decision 

GraphDB is beyond DB and more of an approach to structure the information between NPCs, Candidates, Program Offerings, Service Offerings. All these are expected to change based on the NPC Roadmap planning and Candidate Aspirations. As the datasets are continously evolving and it requires efficient processing of many to many relationships, specially for personalization Graph DB is chosen.

It brings in greater flexibily and quick decision making

NPC and Candidate Matching

On the Network HUB Core subdomain as it's all networking and build relationships across NPCs Graph DB gives greater flexibility and it can give the best recommendation engine. 

## Rationale 

## Status
Proposed. 

## Consequences
It's niche skill and it need training.
