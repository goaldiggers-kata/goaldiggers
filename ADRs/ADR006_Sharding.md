# ADR 006: Sharding

Data sharding is dividing data into horizontal partitions that are organized into various Graph instances or servers. This gives us to spread the load across multiple access points based on the Non Profit community activities on the HUB.

These shards can be accessed individually or aggregated to see all of the data based on need. This gives the ability to access in distributed sources in the form of a common graph partitioned on multiple databases.
